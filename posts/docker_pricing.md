# Pricing Changes at Docker

## 2021 - Rollout of pro model

Prior to 2021, Dockers packaging consisted of 3 tiers

In Aug 2021, Docker unveiled a major update to its product subscriptions, introducing a four-tier model: Docker Personal, Pro, Team, and a new Business plan. Docker Desktop now requires a subscription for businesses with more than 250 employees. While Docker Desktop remained free for personal use, education, and non-commercial open-source projects, businesses with more than 250 employees or over 10M in revenue, a paid subscription starting at $5 a month is required for professional use in larger enterprises.

Based on my conversations with people who were at the company at the time of pricing changes, they was able to guesstimate number of users for specific large account based on user emails (company domains being used). This wasn't accurate as some users would use thier personal emails. Nevertheless Docker used these numbers to identify large accounts. Docker then sent out emails to companies with more than 250 users indicating non-compliance with the new terms and conditions and providing 90 days to pay up. The effective date for these terms was August 31, 2021, so they provided a grace period until January 31, 2022. 

### Pricing Model



### Outcome

This helped them generate revenue from 0 to $10M in 1 year. Intitially the company was able to retain over 80% of the users. Hoeverever post transition, the curn rates went up. as procurement teams failed to see value in the paid offering compared to the free ones.

This was a significant shift — previously, Docker Desktop had been freely used in many enterprise environments. Businesses had to budget for Docker usage: for example, a company could choose Docker Team or Business to equip their developers. The Docker Business tier ($21/user/month) was introduced specifically to address enterprise needs (e.g. SSO, enhanced security, centralized admin)

Over the years the company has continued to increase value to the paid subscriptions by adding features like 'Docker Scout' which scans containers for vulnerable open source components.
